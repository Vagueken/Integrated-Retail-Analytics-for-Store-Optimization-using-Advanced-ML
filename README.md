# Integrated-Retail-Analytics-for-Store-Optimization-using-Advanced-ML


Project Title:
"Integrated Retail Analytics for Store Optimization and Demand Forecasting"

Project Objective:
To utilize machine learning and data analysis techniques to optimize store performance, forecast demand, and enhance customer experience through segmentation and personalized marketing strategies.

1. **Data Cleaning**: Added negative sales check to ensure data validity.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Included lagged sales and holiday proximity to capture temporal patterns, enhancing forecasting accuracy.
3. **Time-Series Analysis**: Added ARIMA and decomposition to address time-series requirements, improving trend and seasonality understanding.
4. **Market Basket Analysis**: Simulated via department correlations, as transaction data was unavailable, providing actionable bundling insights.
5. **Customer Segmentation**: Clarified store vs. customer segmentation; used store-level clustering but noted department patterns for customer inference.
6. **External Factors**: Added partial dependence plots to quantify CPI/unemployment/fuel price impacts, enhancing business relevance.
7. **Strategies**: Detailed specific actions (e.g., department bundling, holiday stocking) with feasibility considerations.
8. **Code Quality**: Modularized with clear comments; ensured single-run execution.
9. **Visualizations**: Added time-series decomposition and cluster scatter plots for clarity.
